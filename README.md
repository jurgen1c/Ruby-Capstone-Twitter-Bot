## Setup

## Description

- The purpose of this bot is to apply some social pressure to the current government cabinet of my country (Costa Rica), by reminding each of them how many days they have left to enact change until the next election. This pressure is backed up with data from the national census ministry on unemployment and the current data on covid cases from worldometers.info. The bot will only run on Friday to allow enough time between tweets for scraper data to have changed, if an attempt is made to run it on a different day of the week the bot will ask you to please wait until next friday.
